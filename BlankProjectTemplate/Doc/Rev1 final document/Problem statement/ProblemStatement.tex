\subsection*{Issues that need to be addressed}
\indent

For our movie reviews application to be useful, we will need to incorporate a very large number of movies. This means that searching for movies and sorting by ratings will pose a performance issue if our code is inefficient. We will have to be calculative about which searching and sorting algorithms we want to use within our application
	
Another issue to be addressed will be the user interface. The open source project we have selected implements very smooth transitions to enhance the user experience. Replicating these animations will be a challenging task and may require us to learn XML in depth.
	
Furthermore, the open source project allows users to view movie trailers by redirecting them to YouTube. In order for us to implement this, we will need to manually search for the URLs for all movies featured in our application to ensure that we provide the highest quality videos for the users. This can be a tedious and time-consuming task. 

\subsection*{What problem are you trying to solve?}
\indent

The problem we are trying to solve deals with empowering people to make informed choices when choosing which movie to watch. We are solving this problem through our application by providing a comprehensive list of movies along with a summary and trailer for each one.

\subsection*{Why is this an important problem?}
\indent

Time is of essence in this day and age. People often waste a lot of time searching for an enjoyable movie that matches their interests since there are so many options available. Our application aims to make the process of selecting a movie quick and easy.

\subsection*{What is the context of this problem?}
\indent

The stakeholders for this project include: viewers, developers, movie producers, and movie theatres. The viewers can utilize the application to find a movie that they may enjoy. The developers can receive great dividends if the application becomes mainstream. Likewise, movie producers and movie theatres will also receive an increase in revenue due to the publicity obtained from the application. 
	
The software environment of this application is the Android operating system. Nowadays, most mobile phones utilize the Android software, so it is convenient for users to access our application on the go.
