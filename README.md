#H1 MovieGuide
This is an Android App made by me and my friend that makes use of the TMBD API to retrieve and elegantly present a collection of millions of movies to users. Users have the ability to search and sort through any movies they please, and in addition useful summaries, movie ratings and video trailers are provided for all movies. The app can be found on the Google Play Store at the link below:
